My attempt at Kaggle's popular machine learning compeition, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

I perform data-preprocessing in order to extract potentially important features, compare several machine learning methods and optimise the hyperparameters of the best model before evaluating on the unseen data. My code can be found in the predictor.ipynb file above.
